# Glass-Installation-Cost-Automator
Automated glass installation cost estimator using Power Query (M). Cleans raw construction exports, handles dynamic file paths, and calculates unit weights. Features non-linear logic to assign labor time based on weight thresholds. Transforms a 30-min manual process into a one-click tool.

About the project

A tool that automates the glass installation costing process. It solves the problem of unstructured data from design programs.

Technologies used

Power Query (M Language): Data cleansing, non-linear business logic.
Excel: User interface and final calculations.

What does this project do?

Dynamically retrieves data from CSV files (regardless of folder location).
Dynamically removes unnecessary headers and footers.
Calculates the weight of individual panes.
Assigns installation times based on weight thresholds (if...then...else logic).
